This repository contains Data Structures Lab programs and outputs executed by Shreya Anil Gawhane ( Roll No: B-120, Registration No:-24070887 ) in YCCE IT Department.
## DSPD_Lab_Practicals:
Lab1A. [Aim:Write a program to accept 'n'numbers into an array and then calculate the sum of numbers present in odd 
positions and even positions respectively.](https://github.com/ShreyaGawhane/DSPD-Lab_Practicals_YCCE/blob/main/Codes/Lab1A_OddEvenPosition.c)


Lab1B. [Write a program to implement a Binary Search algorithm. Write a search function which takes a SearchList as its first parameter and a Comparable as its second. If either parameter is null, or if the SearchList is empty, you should return NULL.
 implement the following algorithm: 
• Examine the value in the middle of the current array and print it. 
• If the midpoint value is the value that we are looking for, return true 
• If the value that we are looking for is greater than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to start at the midpoint and print the index.
• if the value that we are looking for is less than the midpoint value, adjust the current array to end at the midpoint  and print the index.
• Continue until you find the value, or until the start reaches the end.](https://github.com/ShreyaGawhane/DSPD-Lab_Practicals_YCCE/blob/main/Codes/Lab1B_BinarySearchList.c)
